### **What is IT Asset Management (ITAM)?**
IT Asset Management (ITAM) is the practice of tracking and managing an organization’s IT assets throughout their lifecycle, from procurement to retirement. ITAM encompasses **hardware, software, cloud resources, and network assets**, providing visibility into asset utilization, security risks, and compliance requirements.

#### **Key Components of ITAM:**
- **Hardware Asset Management (HAM):** Tracking physical devices like servers, laptops, mobile devices, and networking equipment.
- **Software Asset Management (SAM):** Managing software licenses, subscriptions, and compliance.
- **Cloud Asset Management:** Monitoring cloud resources, virtual machines, and SaaS applications.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Managing asset procurement, usage, maintenance, and decommissioning.
- **Financial and Compliance Oversight:** Ensuring cost optimization, budgeting, and regulatory compliance.
